/// Test group: amplifier
/// Test purpose: width and position
///
/// Test description:
/// Play keys c4 to a4, verify the following behavior:
///
/// c4: sample is played in mono, centered. No volume correction is performed
///     so combining the width effect with the volume effect both equal gain 
///     and equal power compensations are possible.
///
/// d4: sample is played in stereo, centered
/// e4: sample is played in mono, in right channel
/// f4: sample is played in mono, in left channel
/// g4: sample is played with a reduced stereo width, slightly to the right
/// a4: sample is played with a reduced stereo width, slightly to the left
/// b4: sample is played in 'enhanced stereo', centered
///
/// 'Enhanced Stereo' (as it's called in other samples) uses the old, cheap
/// but effective trick used in 1970 tape recorders of injecting to one channel
/// part of the other channel out of phase. This results in a wider stereo image
///
/// Don't use it on bass samples. Wide but weak.
