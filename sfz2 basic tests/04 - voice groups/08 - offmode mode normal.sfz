///
/// Test description:
/// When a region is muted by its exclusive one, it can either pass thru the 
/// normal release stage (as if it was released), or be set into a 'fast release'
/// status, which will kill it instantaneously (fast enough to avoid clicks
/// actually). This shows the normal release off mode.
///
/// Play and hold any note above c4, then play any note below c4. Verify the note
/// being set into normal release.
