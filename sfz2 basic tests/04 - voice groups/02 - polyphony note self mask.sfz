///
/// Test description:
/// Play and hold several notes, verify that the polyphony is limited to 12
/// notes. 
/// Release all notes, press and hold the sustain switch. Play repeatedly any
/// note with increased velocity, verify that the polyphony is limited to 3
/// notes.
///
/// By default, repeated playback of same note has the 'self mask' feature on.
/// With 'self mask' activated, if the incoming note has a higher velocity than
/// any of the notes which are sounding (for the same note), the softer note
/// will be stealed. Otherwise, the player will ignore the 'note_polyphony'
/// limit and allocate a new voice.
